[[H2Database]]
= Test the JPA Database with H2
:imagesdir: ../..

Before testing the database, make sure the application backend is running.
If the application isn't running, run the following in the `optaweb-employee-rostering-backend` directory:

[source,shell]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

Go to http://localhost:8080/h2-console to view the H2 database console.
Enter `org.h2.Driver` in the `Driver Class` field and `jdbc:h2:mem:employeerostering` in the `JDBC URL` field, and keep the other default values.
Connect, and click on the entities on the left to run SQL statements.
This console allows you to view and modify the application database.
